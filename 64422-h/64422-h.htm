  <h2 class='c002'>A PUZZLED CAT.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Teheran, the Persian cat, was dozing on a rug in the
hall. Suddenly her hair stood on end, and her tail
grew large. What-ever was that thing coming down-stairs?
She had opened her eyes just in time to see at the head of
the long flight of stairs some strange animal, with great eyes
and long sharp teeth. To her horror, it slid quickly down
stairs, directly toward her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It did not take her long to run from the mat and dodge
the fierce-looking animal. She turned to look, and there lay
the four footed beast, just where she had lain. What could
he be, and what was he doing in that house? There he lay
quietly. Could he be asleep? Pussy-like, she crawled toward
him, ready to spring if he stirred. She walked round
him with her back up. No, he wasn’t asleep. His eyes were
wide open. Was he lying in wait, ready to spring at her?</p>

<p class='c005'>Round and round him she walked. Not an ear did he
raise, not a whisker did he twitch, not an eyelid did he wink.
What a curious fellow!</p>

<p class='c005'>Had he died of heart disease coming down-stairs so fast?
Her eyes opened wider. She pricked up her ears to listen.
Not a breath could she hear. Poor fellow, he must be dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>She grew bolder. She played with his paws, and she
pulled his tail. She brushed by his side. How queer! No
fat, no bones! She put one paw on his back, two paws,
three paws, all four paws. How flat! no heart, no stomach, no
insides at all. She sat down on him to think. What was he?</p>

<p class='c005'>Many a day she thought about him; many a time she
played with him; many an hour she watched him. But a
puzzled cat she always remained.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>ON THE BEACH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This little girl has come with her mamma from the noisy
city, Paris. She has a shrimping net in her hand, and
thinks she can catch shrimps.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fish-wife is surprised to see a little girl in such fine
clothes on the beach. The little girl is curious about the
fish-wife. Do you wish to know what they are talking
about? Listen!</p>

<p class='c005'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Êtes vous de Paris?</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oui.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Combien y a-t-il de temps que vous êtes ici?</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n’y a que trois jours.</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>Do you understand? You do if you are studying French.
They both talk French although they are dressed so differently.
The little girl is very much interested in the funny
dress of the fish-wife. The fish-wife is very much pleased
with the pretty dress of the little girl. She says under her
breath “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’elle est jolie!</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>They look each other over from top to toe, and talk awhile.
Then the fish-wife goes back to her work. The little girl
pokes the shrimping-net into the water and tries to catch
the shrimps.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>DOROTHY’S CALL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Dorothy was wandering about the house, wondering
what to do. She strayed into Grandma’s room. On
the bureau lay Grandmas’s cap. Dorothy tried it on, and
thought she looked very like Grandma. There lay a pair of
spectacles. She tried those on too.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly a scheme came into her wise little head. She
went to Grandmas’s closet, found one of her dress skirts, and
put on that. Grandma was a short woman, and Dorothy
was a pretty big girl for her age, still the skirt was a trifle
long in front. Grandma didn’t wear short sleeves and high-necked
aprons. Grandma’s black shawl was just the thing
to cover them up, Dorothy thought, as she fastened it with
Grandma’s big pin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>DOROTHY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>She walked quietly into the hall. Quietly, because she
wasn’t sure that Grandma would be pleased. She couldn’t
see through the spectacles. She clung to the bannisters, or
down the whole flight of stairs she would have gone at one
step. Shoving the glasses to the end of her nose, she went
on her way. Around the corner lived a poor old lady that
Grandma sometimes called on. Dorothy walked to her door
and knocked. The old lady came to the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Mrs. Johns!” said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning,” answered Mrs. Johns, looking at her
caller curiously. “Come in, wont you, and sit down? I
don’t just recall you, though you do seem familiar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name is Swinton,” said Dorothy. (So it was and so
was her Grandmother's).</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Swinton? You must excuse
me for not knowing you. I’m getting hard o’hearing, and my
eyes aren’t as good as they were once. And how are you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have a little rheumatiz, and sometimes a ‘stick’ in my
back,” answered Dorothy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your voice doesn’t sound natural, but perhaps it’s my
ears. Does your throat trouble you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh no!” said Dorothy, growing nervous. “I guess I
better be going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Going! Why you’ve just come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Dorothy hurried away, rather quickly for an old lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well I never!” muttered Mrs. Johns. “She must be going
out of her mind, she acted so queer. The rheumatiz must
be in her brain. She walked too fast to have it in her legs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Grandma was surprised to see Dorothy coming into the
house, dressed in her clothes. She couldn’t help smiling
while Dorothy told her all about her call.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Grandma,” said Dorothy, “she didn’t find out that
I was only myself, and not yourself at all!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>FIDO’S PUPPIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Fido was the proud mother of four puppies. They were
born in a clothes basket. While they were very young
they did not offer to leave their warm bed. They snuggled
close to their mother, and when she went off for a walk they
cuddled together.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>They soon became venturesome, like most dogs and boys.
Two were particularly so. They jumped over-board to go
on a tour of inspection, the mother’s sharp eyes following.</p>

<p class='c005'>The third, not quite so bold, just leaned over the edge
of the basket. He leaned too far, and out he tumbled, and
then tried to climb back. The fourth was too lazy to move,
and kept under cover.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dear, big, old Colonel eyed curiously these fat, faltering,
four-legged new-comers. And the new-comers eyed him.
They sat in judgment over his tail as it lay on the ground.
They never thought of its being a tail. They only knew
one kind, like theirs and their mother’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>While they were thinking, the Colonel raised this bushy
tail. It struck one under the jaw, making him turn a back
somersault; it rolled the other puppy over. They were very
much surprised, and waddled back to the basket as fast as
their weak legs could carry them. The Colonel smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>These two dogs grew bolder as they grew older. Once,
when their mother was away, they went on another inspecting
tour, taking the most timid puppy with them.</p>

<p class='c005'>They jumped up the front steps of their masters house.
Seeing the front door open, they decided to call. They did
not know that the proper way was to ring the bell and hand
in cards. They simply walked in and found their way to
the parlor. What fine curtains to roll on! What beautiful
lace to tear! What gay cords and tassels to pull! Such a
lark!</p>

<p class='c005'>That which attracted them most was a mat made of a
wolf’s skin and head. At first they were afraid, but seeing
he did not injure them, they pulled him about at a great rate.
They were having such a good time, they made some noise.</p>

<p class='c005'>The maid surprised them, and stopped their little game by
appearing with a whip. The puppies went out the front door
faster than callers usually go; and they never so much as
said good-afternoon.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE HISTORY LESSON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Kate was trying to learn her history lesson. She thought
she never could learn the names of all the Presidents
of the United States, and recite them in their order. Her
eyes would stray to the story books. Her mind would
wander to “Lady Constance,” who had her right hand cut
off to save the life of her dear husband. And to Cinderella
and her lost slipper. And to the Prince who found it and
married her. In fact she could think of everything except
the Presidents of the United States.</p>

<p class='c005'>While she was wasting her time, Cousin Anna came in
to call.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What makes you look so cross, Kate?” Cousin Anna
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t get my lesson,” lamented Kate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is your lesson about?” asked the cousin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the Presidents, and I get so mixed up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you the list in rhyme?” asked Anna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Cousin Anna. I never saw it,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you must have that. It is so easy to learn. We
used to learn the English Sovereigns in rhyme. I remember
so well our reciting;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c005'>“And so on. And now Mrs. Peter has put our Presidents

      <div class='line'>‘First Washington, then Adams,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>John Adams’ son—John Q.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“And so forth. Come home with me and I’ll get you her
little book. She has the important events of each administration
all in rhyme, too. For instance, under Grover
Cleveland is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Twas after twenty years and four</div>

      <div class='line'>Cleveland his honest record made,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though people did not choose free trade,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Huge labor strikes and feuds arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And earthquakes sealed sad Charleston’s woes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Under ‘Benjamin Harrison,’ she has:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Year eighty-nine brought into view</div>
      <div class='line'>A kinsman of old Tip’canoe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Another Harrison is chief;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now—for good, or else for grief—</div>
      <div class='line'>The tariff and the silver bills,</div>
      <div class='line'>Divide the people’s votes and wills;</div>
      <div class='line'>And liquor traffic still defies</div>
      <div class='line'>The legislation of the wise.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you think you could learn this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes! Cousin Anna,” exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cousin Anna gave the little book to Kate. Kate soon
learned the six short verses, and so knew all the Presidents
and in their order.</p>

<p class='c005'>She learned, too, all the events in rhyme.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE PROOF OF LOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Theresa loves her cat very much. How do I know?
Theresa was hungry. She asked for some milk. She
sat down on the floor to enjoy it. Her dog sat down beside
her. Frisky, her cat, smelling the milk came and sat in front
of her. Frisky did not move her eyes away from Theresa
and her milk. She looked and purred, and purred and looked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Theresa began to feel uncomfortable. She knew Frisky
liked milk but so did she. She felt that Frisky was asking
for some as well as she knew how. Her eyes seemed to say
to Theresa, “I’m very fond of milk and I’d like some of
yours very much indeed.” When the milk passed Theresa’s
heart on its way to her stomach her heart said, “Frisky
wants some too. Poor kittie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Theresa put the bowl down and told Frisky to take a
taste. Frisky put her little red tongue into the bowl and
began tasting the milk. She kept on tasting the milk. She
didn’t once lift up her head and offer to let Theresa have
the rest. Theresa liked her cat so much she couldn’t bear
to pull the bowl away. Frisky’s tongue went fast and so did
the milk. Frisky lapped up every drop. She was only a
cat and did not know she was selfish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some tears came into Theresa’s eyes when she saw that
the milk was all gone. She did not scold nor complain.
Frisky purred, “Thank you.” Theresa took her in her arms
and said, “Nice Frisky!”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>“I CAN STIR IT!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Please cook, let me stir it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Och, no, Miss, you couldn’t,” said cook.</p>

<p class='c005'>Esther thought she could, but didn’t tease.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few hours later Esther came into the kitchen again.
On the table was the same big bowl. In it was the same
stuff that cook stirred. Cook was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a jiffy Esther was on a chair with the spoon in her
hand. “I <i>can</i> stir it,” she said to herself in triumph. It was
easy enough. She stirred till she was tired.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had been back in the sitting-room awhile when the
cook appeared in great distress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Och, Mrs. Borden, me risins all shpiled; and it wasn’t
rats for there’s a shpoon in it.” Mrs. Borden was going to
say, who could it be, when she spied Esther’s face. It was
very red.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Esther, child, did you disturb cook’s sponge for her
bread?” asked Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma, I didn’t see any sponges and bread,” answered
Esther, “but I stirred something in a big bowl. Cook said
I couldn’t. I tried, and I could stir it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Borden convinced Esther that it wasn’t wise to touch
anything in the kitchen without cook’s permission.</p>

<p class='c005'>Esther told cook she was sorry she had made her so much
trouble.</p>

Olive was walking in the yard, when
she heard a voice calling her to come
in. She at once obeyed, and was told
that a lady wished to see her in the
parlor. This lady spoke to Olive very
kindly, asking her if she would like to
go to live with her. Olive, liking the
lady’s face and manner, said she would.</p>

<p class='c005'>Olive had lived in this Orphan Asylum
several years. She was a very sad-looking
child, and no one had wished before to adopt her. This
lady wished to make some poor child happy, and chose
Olive because she seemed so forlorn. Promising to come
for her in a few days, she kissed Olive good-bye.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/illus022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Martin was Olive’s brother, and lived in the Asylum too.
Their mother died when they were very young. Irene, the
eldest child, tried to help her father take care of the children
and the house, but she was never
very well. She grew weaker and
weaker. She used to go off by
herself to cry. She longed for
her mother, and wished she could
go to her. Her wish was granted,
for she died too.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>The father couldn’t look after
Martin and Olive, so he put them
in the Orphan Asylum. It wasn’t
very long before the father was
taken ill, and had to go to a hospital,
where he died. That left Martin and
Olive without father or mother, or anybody
in the wide world to love them.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Olive told Martin she was
going away with a sweet lady, he threw
up his arms and rushed down the garden
quite wild-like. Martin was old enough
to realize that his little sister was to be
taken away from him, and he could never
be with her any more. It nearly broke his heart even to
think about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Olive began to think too. They cried and they thought,
they planned and they talked. Olive told the matron she
couldn’t leave Martin, but the matron said she must. When
the lady came for her, Olive cried very hard, and asked if
she please couldn’t take Martin too, for he wouldn’t have any
little sister at all if she went away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Martin came to say good-bye. He and Olive clung to
each other. While they sobbed, the matron scolded and
the lady pondered. Finally the lady asked the matron’s
permission to take Martin for a few days’ visit. That stopped
the crying and the scolding, and away the children went in
great glee.</p>

<p class='c005'>Martin was such a quiet, good boy, and so happy to be
with them, that the lady and her husband decided to keep
both children. Neither they nor the children ever had any
reason to regret it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Olive and Martin had had so little fun in their lives, had
shed so many tears, and had known so much about trouble,
that they were always grateful for everything done for them,
and tried their best to do right. They were very unlike the
children, who, while always being indulged and petted, are
nevertheless discontented.</p>

sleek white well-fed pig, cosily curled up in a nest of
nice clean straw.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some folks get all the good things in this world, I think,”
grumbled the cur. “Here is that great fat lazy pig, fed on
the best of everything—peas, potatoes, sweet milk, barley-meal,
and I know not what all—whilst I am kicked and
cuffed, and have to pick up a meal anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dick!” cried the farmer out of the window. “Be up
to-morrow at four o’clock. We’ll kill the white pig for
Saturday’s market; and a roast leg of pork won’t come amiss
for Sunday’s dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning the cur was awakened early by strange
sounds. “A—h!” said he, as he shivered in his straw, and
sat up to listen; “I see now, they only fattened up poor
piggy for their own sakes. Seeming good fortune may not
be best for us after all. It is better to live poorly in security

know one to match poor boys. Big brover said it was so

keeping close to his heels. In some way Nibs and Dandy
get out of the house unnoticed. After Nibs raises the umbrella,
he halts a moment, Dandy waiting beside him. His

Clarence was afraid, and would scream with all his
might, and he is more timid now than he will be when he
learns how to swim.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hazel is not afraid. She does not go far from shore, and
enjoys sporting in the cool soft water. Clarence keeps her
busy. The water that is shallow for Hazel, is deep for him.
He is a small boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! oh! oh!” cries Clarence. “There’s a fish nibbling
my toe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense!” says Hazel. “A kick and a splash will
scare them all away. Now I will teach you how to swim.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m afraid! I’ll drown!” cries Clarence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you’re afraid, you will. But you must learn not to
be afraid. Salt water is strong and will hold you up. And
besides, I am here to take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So Hazel puts her hand under him and Clarence stretches
himself, face downward, on top of the water. Then he folds
his hands together, and spreads them out again, pushing the
water away from him, and using his feet as paddles, and is
quite proud of his success. He wants to learn how to swim,
so that if he should go out in a boat and be thrown over-board,
he could keep his head above water until help came.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Clarence comes out of the water he must be well
rubbed, and oh, how his cheeks will glow! Then he must
take a run on the shore.</p>

too nice when you go crabbing. The boys must look after
the girls and see that their lines are all right. Now—have
you plenty of elbow room? Is the bait tied on so that it
cannot get off? Then swing the line and throw it so that
the bait falls well out into the creek. Now wait—and hold
on to the other end of your line. Do you feel a jerk? a
pull? Then haul in very slowly, and
be ready with the nets, Bob and Tom.
Slip the net under the crab as soon as
it is near the shore. If you do not it
will get away. Look! There is a crab
with but one large claw! It broke off
the other in trying to get away. A
crab will often lose a claw rather than
be taken in a net.</p>

<p class='c005'>See that one dart off under the seaweed!
Now we have all that we need. Let us roll up our
lines and go home. Look at John, with a crab fast to his
coat. Oh! what fun we have had!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>PETER’S WORK-SHOP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Peter is fond of tools. He loves to saw and hammer,
and to drive nails. Oh, what a noise he makes! He
has a room all to himself in the upper part of the house, and
here he spends most of his time on rainy days when he is
out of school.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is handy to have such a boy as Peter around, for if a
hinge gets loose, or a piece of board is wanted, there is no
need of sending for a carpenter; Peter will attend to it just
as well as the best.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nellie, Dotty, and Susy, bring him their dolls to mend,
and sometimes he has so much work of this sort to do that his
work-shop looks like a dolls’ hospital. He has a sign upon
the wall—“Dolls mended”—and
he tries his best to do his
work well, and to keep his
tools bright.</p>

<p class='c005'>Poor little Dotty was almost
broken-hearted when Laura
Matilda fell and broke her
arm; but Jessie said “Peter can
mend it;” and Dotty took it
to Peter herself for she would
not trust the dear doll out of
her arms. She has to sit
patiently and wait her turn,
just as sick people do in the
hospital, and is comforted by
seeing other dolls worse off
than poor Laura Matilda. What if she had broken her neck?
or smashed her head? O that is too dreadful to think of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter has an order for a bench, and after he has sawed the
board the right length, he will have to use the plane and
make it nice and smooth, and all this takes time. Dotty
thinks he is very slow; but there are some things that cannot
be done fast, and “what is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.” Have patience, little Dotty!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE TIDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Mildred came over to spend an afternoon with Gertie.
Gertie led Mildred to her favorite spot. It was out
on the rocks, away out to the very last one that could be
seen above the water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Gertie took off her shoes and stockings. Mildred felt too
much dressed up to do that. They sat on the rock, Gertie
dangling her feet in the water. They talked, and they
laughed, and they sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little fishes in the water,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who has taught you how to swim?</div>
      <div class='line'>Has your mother or your father</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shown you how to use each fin?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little fishes in the water,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>How to live, and how to thrive?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Gertie looked toward the shore. The tide was
coming in. Already some of the stepping stones were
covered with water. Her stockings and shoes were gradually
being carried away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mildred was frightened. Gertie looked very brave but
wasn’t so calm as she looked. She picked up her soaked
shoes and stockings. They started for the beach. They ran
and they jumped. Mildred wasn’t sure footed. She slipped
and she slopped. Her shoes were soon wet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The water rose higher and higher. No use in jumping,
for the rocks and stones were now covered. Poor Mildred
had to wade through the water with her new shoes and
stockings on her feet. But her shoes were not any wetter
than Gertie’s were in her hand. Mildred’s pretty dress was
badly wet, too.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gertie took her visitor to her room to get her clothes dry.
She felt ashamed to think she had forgotten about the tide.
She was sorry she had by her thoughtlessness marred the
pleasure of Mildred’s visit.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE LITTLE MOTHER.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Lulu’s dolls are so large that you would think they were
real flesh and blood. She likes to have them large, she
says, for then she can hug them, and make it seem as if they
were alive. Her doll-baby, Flo, is just the size of her little
sister, Baby May, and it is hard sometimes to tell which
one she has in her arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lulu is a real little mother girl. She takes the best of care
of her dolls, and fondles them, and talks to them just as if
they knew all that she said. She makes all their clothes, and
keeps them in good order, and it would surprise you to see
how well she sews.</p>

<p class='c005'>She is gentle and kind in all her ways, but sometimes she
has to scold G. W. and B. F. and stand them in a corner.</p>

<p class='c005'>They are such bad boys. Lulu has not made up her mind
yet whether she will call them George Washington and
Benjamin Franklin, or more fancy names, but has become
so used to G. W. and B. F. that it will be quite hard for her
to make any change. When night comes on Lulu sings her
dolls to sleep, and then puts them in their own little beds
where they rest quietly until daylight. If they were real
children, and cried out in the night with aches, and pains,
and bad dreams, what a hard time Lulu would have!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE STOLEN CHILD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This is a sad story, as you might well know. But sad
things will take place now and then, and we cannot help
it. It is a story about a little boy, named Peter. That was
to be his name when he grew up, but now nobody called
him anything but Pete.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pete had had a bad fall when a little baby and it left him
with a weak back, so that he could not run and romp like
the rest of the small boys. He had toys to play with, but
they were not nice or new, and he soon tired of them.
What he wanted most was a doll. Really? Yes. He was
ashamed to let the boys know it for fear they would call
him “Sissy,” but deep down in his heart there was a strong
desire for a doll to hug, and to hold, and to take to bed
with him.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day a lady came to the house, and somehow she
guessed just what kind of a boy Pete was. Without saying
a word, she took a small shawl off a hook, gave it a fold and
a roll, pinned it together and then handed it over to the
small boy.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>You should have seen Pete’s face! There was not room
on it for the broad smile that tried to get there, and finally
had to break itself all up into little bits. Oh, how he hugged
and loved that doll! and
he soon got so he did not
mind being seen on the
street with it in his arms.
There was no danger of
breaking it; and it could
sit down bea—u—ti—fully.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day Pete thought
he would try to climb a
lamp-post. He had seen the other boys do it, and it looked
easy, but he would need two hands. So the doll—Matilda
Jane—had to sit down on a stoop near by, and wait until
Pete came back for her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, it was not long; but when Pete got back to the
place where Matilda Jane was he could not find her.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was go——o——o——ne! Somebody had stolen her!</p>

<p class='c005'>Pete was heart-broken. He cried, and cried, and cried.
He should never see his own dear Matilda Jane again!
And the worst of it was that he wouldn’t know her if he
saw her. Even his mother laughed, and said “Oh, it was
only an old shawl. No great loss!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Pete’s heart was wrapped up in that shawl and that is
what makes this a sad story. He might have other dolls,
but none that would take the place of his Matilda Jane.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>CAUSE FOR THANKFULNESS.</h2>

      <div class='line'><span class='c004'>F</span>ast asleep, fast asleep, are these dear little girls;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On the pillow are laid their two heads, full of curls,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And of dreams gay and bright:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their prayers these sweet little maidens have said,</div>
      <div class='line'>And their stockings hung up at the head of their bed,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To be filled this glad night.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>While they dream their mother sits beside them. While
she fills their stockings with gifts, her heart is filled with
praise. Her two little girls are both alive and well. It is
not many weeks since the elder was very ill. The mother
had been very sorrowful at the thought of losing one of her
own dear girls.</p>

<p class='c005'>What queer fancies sick people have! This little girl
while ill imagined many things. She thought she was a
fairy riding in a little golden carriage driven by two small
white kittens, and that the doctor was a giant. She told him
he was too big to take a drive with her, he would smash her
carriage and kill her kittens. If he would be good, and not
make her swallow such horrid stuff, she would change him
into a dear little Puck, with a green jacket and a lace ruff.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes she thought she was an angel flying through
the air. She said she was sitting on a horn of the moon, but
would fly off soon to a world way off out of sight. That
made her mother cry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once she very politely asked her father—a very large
man—to take a seat on the mantle-piece, as she thought the
room was crowded. And once she thought she was a clown
in a circus, and tried to stand on her head in bed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>She was very ill; but she got well, however. Now it is
Christmas eve. The mother is happy and thankful because
there are two little girls instead of one.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>PLATO’S SOLILOQUY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Do I look like a happy dog? Do I look like a handsome
dog? Do I look like a respectable dog? Is this what
the other dogs call fun?</p>

<p class='c005'>My master is a very kind man. He has brought me up
well. I knew he did not like his dogs to stay out all night,
nor wander off at any time with vulgar dogs. I had over-heard
dogs talking about the fun they had when off together.
I had been invited a number of times to join them. I had
always refused until last night. Then I made up my mind I
was going to have some fun too. So quietly slipping away,
I ran around the corner and off with the dogs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fun? Yes, we did have fun, though an uneasy sneaky
feeling would come over me at times to interfere with my
happiness. Fun? Yes, but it ended in a fight! Fun? Yes,
we did have fun, but I’m not having any now!</p>

<p class='c005'>One eye nearly gone, one ear half chewed off, a hole in
my cheek, a hump on my leg, my master in sorrow, and I in
disgrace, to say nothing of aches and of pains. It will be
some time before I get my good looks back again, or my
usual fine gait. Three-legged and one-eyed! Ugh!</p>

<p class='c005'>Fun? Yes! But if any dog imagines that I think it
pays, he is very much mistaken. When I let myself down
again to go off with vulgar dogs, no matter what the fun,
may I be locked in the asylum for foolish and insane dogs!!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE KING’S DAUGHTER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>She does not look like a Princess, with her plain fur cap
and cape, and driving her own sleigh. Yet a daughter
of the King she is.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you could look under the fur robe, you would find a
doll’s carriage, and in it two dolls all dressed for a drive.
You would find a doll’s bed, with pillows, blankets, mattress
and spread. You would find a pair of skates, a sled, some
mittens, handkerchiefs, caps, and hoods; and a basket of
candles, spangles, and small toys for a tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>This “King’s Daughter” did not pay for them all. She
is only one of a circle of Daughters. They saved their
money, they bought the toys, they made the clothes, and
they dressed the dolls, not for themselves, not for their own
little brothers and sisters, but for a family of children who
but for them would have no presents at all. Their father is
poor and ill, and their mother earns but little.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is the day before Christmas. This King’s Daughter
is taking these things to the home of those poor children.
The other Daughters will meet her there, to trim a tree they
have ordered. The poor mother will help them, forgetting
her sorrows for a while. The sick father will smile as he
looks on. This will be his last Christmas-tree on earth, as
he can not live much longer. He is very glad the King
has sent his daughters to do for the children what he is not
able to do for them himself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c005'>On Christmas day will come a basket, full of good things
to eat, which these same girls have provided. These girls
by saving their money have had less candy to eat, fewer
trinkets to wear, and perhaps a little less fun. But think
of the comfort and happiness they will give to those poor
children, that sad mother, that sick father!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>GETTING READY FOR BED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Allan thought it was time he learned to get himself
ready for bed. He wished to be a man as soon as
possible. That, he thought, would be one way to grow
manly. So he kissed everybody good-night and went upstairs
to bed all alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>No, not exactly alone, for Toodles went with him. Allan
did not admit it to anybody, but he really was very much
obliged to Toodles, as he was a great deal of company.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now Toodles, you watch me undress, and see if I don’t
know how!” And Toodles watched.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see that, Toodles?” asked Allan as he put out one
foot with a stocking on it. “That is where I keep some of
my pigs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pur-r-r, pur-r-r,” said Toodles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure!” said Allan. “You can’t see them, for they are
all covered up; but they are there. Now, look!” Allan
jerked off the stocking and wiggled his toes before Toodles’
very nose. “See, five of them!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pur-r-r, pur-r-r,” said Toodles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And here’s where I keep all the others!” said Allan as
he held up the other stockinged foot. “See them?” Off went
that stocking. “Are they not nice little pigs? There’s the
one that went to market, and there’s the one that said, ‘squeak,
squeak.’” Allan poked his bare foot into Toodles’ ribs and
wiggled his toes in his fur.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c005'>“Pur-r-r, pur-r-r,” said Toodles.</p>

<p class='c005'>Allan got his clothes off, but found it hard to get his nightgown
on. His hands would go into the legs of the gown.
His feet would go into the arms of the gown. He and the
gown got all tangled up. Toodles couldn’t help him. He
could only encourage him by saying “Pur-r-r, pur-r-r.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mamma came up and straightened him out, and buttoned
his gown behind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Allan said his prayers, asking God to “bless everybody
and Toodles.”</p>

very fond of her brother,
and proud of the boat that
he had made. The two
always played nicely together, and were never known to
quarrel. James liked to please Ella, and Ella liked to please
James, so both were happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was nothing James and Ella enjoyed more than
wading in the shallow water and guiding the little sail-boat—their
newest toy. Ella called James—“Captain”; and James
called Ella—“Mate,” and as James wore a sailor-suit he felt
quite like a sea-faring man.</p>

<p class='c005'>James was careful not to let his little boat get out into
deep water, for it had cost him a great deal of time and
trouble to make it, and he did not care to lose it. But one
calm day the Captain and Mate had gone for a drive, leaving
the sail-boat in what they thought was a safe place. While
they were gone, a stiff breeze came up and blew the little
boat away from the shore, and it sailed, and sailed far out of
sight. Wasn’t that too bad?</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>AFTERNOON TEA.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>I have three dolls. Their names are Blanche Amelia,
Capitola, and John Henry. Blanche Amelia and Capitola
are very well-behaved, but John Henry gives me a
world of trouble. I thought it would be nice to have a boy-doll.
But it is not. He is a great care.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I dress up Blanche Amelia and Capitola in their
best clothes, they seem to know that they must act like ladies,
and I am never ashamed of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I love to make believe; don’t you?</p>

<p class='c005'>Mamma and my sister Belle go out to afternoon teas and
receptions, and when they come home I hear them tell how
this one looked, and what that one did, and what the other
one said, and what they all wore, and oh! how I do enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then I have an afternoon tea for my dolls. I have my
own set of dishes, and my own tea-tray, and I pass the cups
around to them just as if they were real folks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Blanche Amelia and Capitola sit up and behave their best,
but John Henry will put his arms on the table, although I
have told him it is not nice to do so.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I play afternoon tea I have to eat all the goodies
myself, and drink all the warm milk, which I call tea, and
when the play is over I am ever so tired. But not a bit
hungry. Oh, no!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>HOW ELMER WAS LET ALONE.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus053.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“I just wish I could be let alone
for a while,” said Elmer Green.
“I am tired, and I don’t want to
do anything for any body.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tired” was another name for
“cross,” and to tell you the truth
this was one of Elmer’s real cross
days. He got up cross, and he
would stay cross for some time.
He always did. It was of no use
to try to please him. It could not
be done. So he took a book and went off by himself, but
was not gone long before he came back for his top. He
spun that for a while; then he got out his toys; then he
counted his marbles; then he thought he would pick some
cherries, but there was no one to go with him, and there was
no fun in going alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>What should he do? He wanted to be amused, and
didn’t know how to amuse himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently he came into the room where his mother was,
and stood around hoping she would ask him to do something
for her. But she did not. She had a great deal to do, and
needed help, but she would not call on Elmer. It made him
feel as if he was of no use to any one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother,” he said at last, “what can I do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please yourself,” was the quick reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was what Elmer had been trying to do, but with
poor success. He hung his head, and felt as cross as a bear.
As he sat in a corner, his mother took up the pail to go out
to the well. Elmer seized the pail out of her hand and drew
the water. He began to feel better. Then he looked around
to see what else he could do. He did not wait to be asked.
The more he did, the more he felt like doing. He had found
out that it was not nice to be let alone; and he also found
out that he pleased himself most by trying to please others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>BY THE MILL-POND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Come, let us sit down under the shade of this big tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>How its branches reach over, and dip down into the
water. It is like a great umbrella. It is an old tree. See
how thick the trunk is. It is nice to sit in its shade on
such a warm day. We will ask the miller to give us some
corn, and we will feed the ducks. There are five of them—white
as snow, and with bright yellow bills and legs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here they come!—one, two, three, four, five. Let us
name them. Ala, Ela, Ila, Ola, Ula. The names sound
very much alike, but that will make no difference to them.
And if you call one the others are sure to follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Quack—quack—quack—quack—quack!</p>

<p class='c005'>They know what we are sitting here for, and they are in
haste to be fed. They are always hungry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now throw the corn out, where the water is deep. See
the ducks dive for it! That one is standing on its head.
How queer it looks, with its yellow legs kicking up on top
of the water. Over goes that one! Heels over head! The
ducks don’t mind. Now let them quack, quack for a while.
Soon they will sail off to their pet feeding-ground, where the
earth is moist and there are soft grasses.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Look! look! What is the matter? A big turtle has
seized one of the ducks by the leg. It cannot get away.
Isn’t that too bad! Now there are only four white ducks
on the mill-pond.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>MRS. BRUIN AND HER CUBS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One afternoon Mrs. Bruin was obliged to leave her cubs
alone. She cautioned them not to go far from their cave
while she was away.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had their usual play together, rolling and tumbling
and chasing each other. They ran farther and farther away
from the cave, as no mother was there to call them back.
They ran around trees and scrambled over logs; they climbed
over rocks and stepped into bogs. Growing tired, they turned
to go to their cave to rest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where was it?</p>

<p class='c005'>They looked into one cave. That was not theirs. They
looked into another cave. That was not theirs. They poked
their noses into hollow trees, they sniffed around between
the rocks. Had their cave moved away! Oh! where were
they! No home! No mother!</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh dear! Frightened nearly to death, these young cubs
took to their heels. They did not know which way to go,
but they ran. Splash! Splash! Into a stream that he didn’t
see, tumbled one little cub. Such a howling as was set up,
by the other little cub. And the howling was not in vain.
It had a very familiar tone to Mrs. Bruin, who was walking
home that way.</p>

<p class='c005'>She hurried to the spot from which it came. She saw at
once the plight of the cubs, and that they were her very own
babies. She made a dash for the little one struggling in the
water and pulled him out by the nape of the neck. Mrs.
Bruin shook him pretty hard, perhaps to shake off the water,
and perhaps to punish him a little. She was very much
surprised to find them in this part of the woods all alone
by themselves. She marched them off to their home. The
walk was an instructive but not a jolly one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE BUNNY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Box and Cox were twins. Griswold, their little master,
was very fond of them. The dogs and the boy were
always together.</p>

<p class='c005'>Griswold let them play with some of his toys, but not with
any they could hurt. Somebody gave Griswold a new toy-rabbit
which he kept safely away from the dogs, except once.
Then he left it on the floor while he went out to see a boy
passing by.</p>

<p class='c005'>Box examined the bunny, nosing and pawing it all over.
Cox tried to get his nose or a paw on it, but Box kept him
off. Suddenly, while Box was looking up, Cox grabbed
bunny by the back and started to run. Box as soon as he
could collect his wits ran too. Such a race! Over the toys,
down the steps, out in the yard, around the house, they
chased and they raced.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cox held the bunny fast in his mouth, and kept the lead
for a long time. Box finally got near enough to catch the
bunny’s head in his mouth. Then came the tug of war.
Cox pulled one way, Box the other. Cox tried to shake Box
off, Box tried to shake Cox off. Cox growled, Box growled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Griswold, coming back to his playthings, missed the dogs
and the bunny, and feared something was wrong. Hearing
some growls, he went to look for the dogs. His heart came
into his mouth as he saw them jerking his bunny with all
their might.</p>

<p class='c005'>He got to them just in time to see poor bunny come apart.
And he came apart so suddenly that Box, with the head in
his mouth, keeled over one way, and Cox, still holding the
back, keeled over the other way. This ending surprised
them. Each dog sat down to think and to pant.</p>

<p class='c005'>Griswold sat down to think and to cry. Griswold’s mother
came to the rescue. She gathered up the remains of the
rabbit, whipped Box and Cox, and consoled Griswold. She
said the bunny’s head could be plastered on; but his expression
would never be quite the same, for one eye was knocked
in, and one ear was gone.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>TOWZER’S FUN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Tiger, Towzer, and Tip, although the pets of one household,
were often jealous of one another.</p>

<p class='c005'>Towzer and Tip were sometimes friendly from sympathy.
Towzer was chained up and couldn’t run away, Tip had had
his wings clipped and couldn’t fly away, while Tiger, the sly
cat, was free to go his way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tiger took his after-dinner nap on top of the large square
post near his kennel. One day, while he was resting up
there, Tip examined the bones on his dinner plate. Tiger,
lying on the steps, saw Tip picking the bones. He loved to
tease Tip by springing at him, and Towzer loved to tease
Tiger. Towzer thought he saw a chance for some fun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tip fastened his eyes on the bone; Tiger fastened his eyes
on Tip; and Towzer fastened his eyes on Tiger. Tip picked
the bone; Tiger tip-toed over the ground; Towzer wagged
his stub of a tail.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Caw-caw, meow-ow, bow-wow!” What a row! Towzer,
Tiger and Tip all in a heap, clawing, scratching, and tumbling
one over the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Caw-caw, meow-ow, bow-wow!” What a row! Feathers
and fur! Claws and paws!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sis-cat!” said a voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>And they “scatted.” There sat Towzer in front of his
kennel, looking as though nothing had happened. Tiger and
Tip were nowhere to be seen. By the contented wag of his
stub of a tail, Towzer showed he had had some fun. He
winked and he blinked as he glanced at some fur and a
feather or two at his feet.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>HIS FIRST CIGAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Please, mister, give me a cigar!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The request was made by Tolomeo, but was not granted
by the person addressed. Tolomeo had seen men smoking.
They seemed to enjoy it. He wished to smoke too. His
income as a news-boy was not large enough to buy cigars,
so he had never smoked.</p>

<p class='c005'>While he was wishing for a cigar, he saw a man throw
away the one he was smoking. It was quite a large piece,
and Tolomeo ran for it. He felt very grand as he thrust one
thumb into his trousers and held the cigar just as he had
seen men hold theirs. He drew the smoke into his mouth,
then let it out, trying to form little rings. He did not know
how, exactly, but he tried to learn, feeling like a big man.</p>

<p class='c005'>His attention was presently called from his smoking to a
queer feeling in his mouth and stomach. There was trouble
all along the line between the two, and Tolomeo was miserable.
The stump of the cigar was forgotten. He only knew
about his dreadful feelings.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hello, old fellow, what’s the matter?” A voice in his ears
and a thump on his back, showed the presence of a friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m sick!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seems to me I smell smoke. I say Tolomeo have you
been making a chimney of yourself?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tolomeo did not answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s what’s the matter; you’ve been smoking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess smoking don’t make fellows sick.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t it though. Tried it before?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t say, I have.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha-ha, ha-ha” laughed the friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep quiet will you. Men wouldn’t smoke if it made
them feel as I do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you make a mistake. Most of them have just
such a time at first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tolomeo was amazed. He wondered how anybody could
get enough fun out of smoking to pay for such bad feelings.
He didn’t try again although he was told if he smoked often
enough he would feel all right. “What’s the use any way?”
he said. “If I grew to like smoking, I’d buy cigars and have
less money for clothes than I have now. Besides I want
to save enough to go to the ball-game. I want my money
for lots of things more fun than smoking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma, may I put a big bunch over Floy’s picture?”
asked Eloise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, my dear, I was just thinking about it myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The mother’s eyes filled with tears as she spoke. Eloise
climbed the step-ladder carefully and placed a beautiful
branch of holly over the picture. Then she sat down on the
top of the ladder. She could not visit with Floy, for Floy
had gone to heaven. This picture was so like her that to sit
near it was something like sitting by Floy herself. She
imagined Floy’s smile grew sweeter and sweeter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m very lonely without you,” she said to the picture.
“I haven’t any little sister to play with now. I wish you
could put your arms around my neck and hug me as you
used to. I wish you could come down from heaven once
in a while any way, so we could have some more good times
together; so we could play with our dolls, or look at our
picture books, or romp. Your Cinderella is just where you
left her. She doesn’t have anybody to play with. I don’t
play with her much because it makes me cry. I don’t play
with my Maleen much neither. I let her sit beside Cinderella
to comfort her. Jennie came over the other day to play
and broke one of your dishes. It made me cry, and Mamma
too, so I put your dishes all away in a box. Mamma has
put all your clothes away too. She is going to give them to
some poor woman who has a little girl about as big as you,
because you’ll never need them any more. I suppose you
have wings now. Do you ever fly down to earth, and can
you see me? I can’t see you; I wish I could.”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>“UNEARTHED.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The master’s three dogs were privileged to come into the
house. One day when they entered they knew at once
there was something new in the house, though nobody said
so, and nothing was seen. Dogs are very wise about some
things.</p>

<p class='c005'>These dogs were sure they were right, and they meant to
prove it by finding this new thing. They smelled of the
chairs and the floor, and trotted about through the house. In
less time than could you or I, they found the door that led
to the room that contained the box that held the new thing
they were in search of. They pushed open the door; they
walked in; they looked at the box; they wagged their tails.
By their manner, one knew they were thinking, “I told you
so! Our noses are better than some people’s brains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The box was large; the cover was off. Nothing could be
seen except a lot of paper, but they knew there was something
there besides paper. They smelled of the paper, they
smelled of the box. The odor excited their nerves. They
could stand it no longer. They tore off the paper and threw
it about.</p>

<p class='c005'>One grew so excited he jumped in the box. His legs
went round something, he couldn’t tell what. It seemed
like a creature that he must drag out. He pulled with all
his might, when up from the box there rose, like a ghost, the
head of a fox. His eyes were wide open and so was his
mouth, his ears stood straight and his tongue hung out. Such
barking and jumping! Trip couldn’t let go, for then the fox
at once dropped below.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p class='c005'>And this was their plight when the master walked in.
All were surprised. The master looked queer. Scold them
he wouldn’t; in fact he felt proud. His dogs, without bidding,
had “unearthed” the fox.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE LITTLE TEACHER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Now, Pussy-diddle, you have eaten your dinner and
it’s time you were taught how to spell. And Doggie-dibble,
you have taken your recess, it is time you were
taught how to read. Come, Pussy-diddle, spell ‘purr.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pur-r-r-r.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That isn’t the way to spell ‘purr;’ you have put in too
many r’s. Try again.” “Pur-r-r, meow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I didn’t ask you to spell ‘meow.’ Put down your paw
and sit up straight. Now try once more to spell ‘purr.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pur-r!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is right. Come here, Doggie-dibble, and sit by
my side and look at this paper with me. Here’s a page of
very fine ladies, and a page of beautiful birds. Oh, here is
the lesson for you. Turn your head this way, Doggie-dibble,
you surely can tell about this. You mustn’t read to
yourself, Doggie-dibble, ’cause then I can’t tell when you
are wrong. Now, sir read aloud.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bow-wow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is a bow-wow, that is right. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wow-wow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good dog! Now, Pussy-diddle, you have learned your
lessons for to-day, and so have you, Doggie-dibble, and
now you may both go to play.”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE HUNGRY DOGS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“We can’t stand it much longer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is so. We are pretty thin now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should say so. Look at my sides. You can see my
ribs so plainly anybody would suppose I had buried all my
old bones there, instead of in the ground.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t suppose master means to starve us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Probably not. But that thought does not fill the hole
in my stomach. We’ve not had a square meal for three
days.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Zip and Jerry were talking, the master came in to
prepare his meal. He lived alone with his two dogs. He
was a good master, but was inclined to be stingy, and was
growing worse. Zip and Jerry lay close together to sympathize.</p>

<p class='c005'>They watched the master put the bread and meat on the
table. They saw him begin to eat. They could hardly
stand it, they had such queer feelings about their ribs.</p>

<p class='c005'>The master left the room a minute. Zip and Jerry looked
into each other’s eyes, as much as to say, “We’ll have to do
it.” They arose, walked to the table, and tried to help themselves.
They did not get many mouthfuls, for the tablecloth
slipped, and everything else came down with a crash
and a crack. The master hurried back, and in great rage
stamped his feet and clinched his fists.</p>

<p class='c005'>Zip was so frightened he turned to run, but Jerry, with his
tail between his legs, stood his ground. He raised his head
and barked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you about you rascals?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bow-wow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you know any better than to do such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bow-wow, bow-wow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Crack my plates and make such a mess!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bow-wow-wow, bow-wow-wow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean by barking?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jerry whined and tried to wag his fallen tail. He tried
to explain as well as he could in dog language. He wished
to say, “You wouldn’t give us enough to eat, and we were
so hungry we had to help ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The master sat down to think. His dogs had never done
such a thing before. Perhaps they were hungry. He
remembered that he hadn’t over-fed them for some time,
and that very day they had asked for food and he had
forgotten to give it. Although he was still pretty angry
about his broken dishes, he felt a little ashamed of himself.
After that day, he gave his dogs better food, and
enough of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE LITTLE PEDDLER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This fine-looking boy is going home from his work. His
mother is poor. He helps her by selling on the streets
the buns that she makes. He calls to the passers-by that he
has buns to sell, “Fresh buns! Fresh buns!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He makes the most money at the railway stations. He
goes to the trains and asks the passengers to buy. “Fresh
buns! Fresh buns!” They like to buy of him, because he has
such a pleasant face and manners, and is always so clean.
He sells many more buns than he would if his hands or
clothes, or baskets were soiled. He sells many more than
he would if he looked cross and was crabbed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>You can see that his baskets are empty. He has sold
every bun that he had; now he is taking home to his mother
all the money he received for the buns. He is a great
comfort to his mother. Every little boy can be that, but
I am afraid there are some little boys who are not.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>URSULA AND HER DOVES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The doves are not afraid of Ursula. They know she
loves them, for she feeds them every day, and is always
kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Do you see that one at her feet? He is looking up into
her face. He wishes to stand on her hand and eat from it;
but one dove already covers her hand, and there is not room
for another.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dove that has just taken a drink from the water-lily
bowl is looking at her too. He will hop on to her shoulder
pretty soon. He knows she often has a little piece of bread
in her mouth, and if he gives her a kiss—the kind doves
give—he will find a bit of bread in his bill.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes a dove will fly to the top of Ursula’s head and
peck at her hair. That is their way of giving love-pats.
They stay near her as long as they can. When she leaves
them, they fly to their dove-cots.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they hear her voice in the garden, they fly to her,
even if she does not call. And whenever she calls they
always come. If Ursula were not kind and good to them,
the doves would not love her.</p>

</div>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus080.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One day Eva was eating
a nice ripe peach.
She thought she would
plant the stone in a
flower-pot and see what
would come of it. Fred
filled the pot with nice
soft earth, and Eva kept
it in a warm place all
winter. Once in a while
she would dig up the
stone to see how it looked,
and one day she
found the stone split in
two and a root starting
from it. Oh, how pleased
she was! and how eagerly
she watched for the
first green shoot to push its way through the soil!</p>

<p class='c005'>In a month or two the peach-tree had grown quite tall,
and when warm weather came Fred told Eva he would set
it out of doors, for there was not room for it in the flower-pot.
It would never be a tree if it had not space to spread
its roots.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fred made a lovely place for it in the garden. He marked
out a circle, and edged it with pretty conch shells. Then he
took his trowel, and dug a deep hole in the centre of this
plot in which he put Eva’s peach tree. Then he packed the
earth around its roots, and raked the ground smoothly, and
sprinkled it with water from his watering-pot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Inside the conch-shells Fred will set out a row of plants,
and do his best to make them and the peach-tree thrive.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eva has promised that Fred shall have the first ripe peach
that she finds on her tree, for he is good and kind to her,
and she loves him very dearly. But she will have to wait
some time yet, for the tree is too young to bear fruit.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Ma-a-a-ow! Ma-a-ow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s that?” asked Donna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why it sounds very much like my little brother crying,”
answered June.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder what’s the matter with him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ma-a-a-ow! Ma-a-a-ow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Both the girls ran fast, thinking he must be very much
hurt from the noise he made. They soon found him, and
did not have to ask what the matter was. His knees and
one hand were covered with dirt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fa-a-a-alled dow-ow-own!” cried Jamie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t cry, Jamie dear,” said June as she put her arms
around him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s too bad, but never mind,” said Donna as she kissed
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ma-a-a-ow! ma-a-a-ow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The girls brushed off the dirt and wiped away the tears,
but still he cried “Ma-a-a-ow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wouldn’t cry any more,” urged the girls, for they found
that he wasn’t hurt. But he did cry more, and I’ll tell you
why if you won’t tell. I think he was afraid that if he stopped
crying, they would stop kissing and petting.</p>

An old German woman came to stay at
the mill, and she used to tell Patty
and Susan about the children in Germany.</p>

<p class='c005'>She said, “I knew a little girl called
Lina, and a boy named Carl; and on
Christmas Eve their mother had a fine
Christmas-tree, with gold and silver
balls, and sugar cherries, and all kinds
of pretty things hanging on its branches. It was lighted
up with a hundred tiny wax tapers, so that there was
quite a blaze in the room; and on the table beside it were
many presents for all the people in the house, and a great
number of playthings for Carl and Lina.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They were just the toys they wished for most. Carl
had a donkey on wheels, and a whip, and Lina a doll, with
a box of clothes, and also a set of tea things.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They were very happy children, and never quarreled,
but lent each other their toys. It was very pleasant to see
them playing together, for they were so kind and obliging.</p>

I must tell you about my cat Posy, and the sound
drubbing she got the other day. Miss Posy had
eaten a hearty breakfast, but, like a little glutton,
wanted more. What should she do, but go into
the garden and seat herself near a peach tree, in
which there was a marten-box. The birds were
busy feeding their little ones, and as long as they were
about, Posy hid under a rose-bush, but soon the old birds
flew away, and then was her chance. Looking around to
see if anybody was on the watch, she crept up the tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jumping on the top of the box, she put her paw into
the hole to feel for a young bird. Suddenly there was the
greatest chatter I ever heard—the old birds had come
back and caught the thief. But they could not make pussy
stir. Then the father bird flew to a big marten-box on
the top of the stable, and in a few moments came back
with all the other martens. They pounced upon Posy, and
pecked her until she was glad to run down the tree and
hide under my skirt.</p>

<p class='c005'>I don’t think she will want a bird lunch again very soon.
If she does, I think she will go without it rather than
venture again to the martens’ home. But kitty only did
what bad boys often do, who know the difference between
right and wrong.</p>

“Ted,” said Katie, from her little bed in the dimly
lighted nursery, “this time to-morrow night, we’ll
be at Poplar Grove.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ted and Katie did not reach their papa’s plantation
until very late the following day, and were so tired from
their journey that they went straight to bed. The next
morning, they crept down stairs to see if their pony had
grown any, and if Dash, the big Newfoundland, would
know them.</p>

<p class='c005'>After breakfast, Mrs. Barton let Ted and Katie go to see
Dame Truman, a nice old woman who had taken care of
Mrs. Barton when she was a baby. When they got to the
cottage, they softly pushed open the door, and peeped in.</p>

Granny,” cried Dame Truman, hugging and kissing them.</p>

pretty to show you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Taking up a pan of dough, she went to the door, and
scattered some of it on the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quack, quack, quack,” was heard, and up waddled an
old duck with four young ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>They looked just like balls of yellow worsted, and Katie
wanted to take up one of the soft little things, only she
felt afraid of the old mother. They were overjoyed when
Dame Truman said that the little ducks were for them.</p>

When Henry’s birthday came, he put a garland
of red roses around Malcom’s neck. Malcom
was a handsome brown fawn, with a white
breast. He did not stay with the other deer
in the park, but had a place fenced off for his
own playground. Henry brought him sugar
and sweet cakes, and he fed from his hand, and followed
his little master around like a pet dog.</p>

<p class='c005'>Henry lived in Scotland, and his father was the chief of
the MacDonald clan. Upon his birthday, all the tenants,
with their wives and children, came to the castle to dinner.
Tables were spread in the great hall, loaded with good
things. Henry, dressed in his Highland dress, stood by his
father’s side, and listened to the speeches made in his
honor. Afterward, there were games played in the park,
cricket, wrestling matches, and shooting with the bow and
arrow. Prizes were given to the boys who showed the
most skill.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Henry was watching the games, Malcom came
and rubbed his nose against him, as if to say, “Don’t forget
me.” But when the bagpipes began to play, he was
frightened, and bounded off amongst the trees.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Malcom’s horns grow, he will be turned out
with the herd of deer, but Henry will get the keeper to
put a mark upon his pet, so that he may always know him.</p>

Peter would never take the trouble to learn
the Multiplication Table. He always looked
at the printed card when he did his sums, until
his teacher caught him at it, and took the card
away. Then he fell to making marks on his
slate, and counting on his fingers, but it did no good.
Poor Peter was kept in every day.</p>

<p class='c005'>Look at him nearly tearing his hair out over five times
seven. If he finds that hard, what will he do with eight
times eight, which you know is a stumbling-block to all
little folks?</p>

<p class='c005'>It is recess, and he sits alone in the school-room. He
hears through the open window the merry shouts of the
boys. They are playing base ball, and he knows his side
will be beaten without his help—for I am sorry to say,
Peter plays games better than he does sums.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tears roll down his cheeks, and he mutters, “I wish
arithmetic had never been heard of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Take heart, Peter, and try again. Such great men as
Macaulay and Sir Walter Scott did not like figures when
they were little boys—yet see what perseverance did for
them.</p>

This funny little fluffy snowball comes from far-away
Mexico, where, once upon a time, they
used to eat dogs, nicely baked. They were
considered “a dainty dish to set before a king;”
but they were big, savage, voiceless brutes, not at
all like the pretty mite I have drawn for you. He
can make noise enough, and, if he were alive, would fly at
you, and fancy that you were very frightened. I wonder
why it is only small dogs that are noisy. Your big black
fellow, with a head like a bear, gives a solemn deep-toned
growl, but a mite that would go in your pocket can be
heard all over the house. Well, after all, they are only
like children, and like to make a disturbance, I suppose.</p>

Over a hundred years ago, there lived a
little girl, named Angelica Kauffman. She
was very fond of drawing, and made pictures
of everything she saw. Her father and
mother were poor, but they were so anxious
for her to become a great painter that they
moved to Italy to live. Before she was grown, her mother
died, and then she had to take care of her old father.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day, when she was in Venice, a rich English lady
gave her an order to paint a picture of her little girl.
This made Angelica’s fortune, for the lady was so pleased
with the young artist that she took her to London. Everybody
there was very kind to her, and she became a famous
painter. One of her best friends was Sir Joshua Reynolds,
the great English artist.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was so sweet and pretty that people called her “Miss
Angel” instead of Angelica. When you are older you
must read her life, for it makes a beautiful story.</p>

One morning Miss Kitty Greytoes took a walk in
the garden. The sun was shining, the apple
and cherry trees were in bloom, and the air was
filled with the scent of pinks and lilacs. But
Miss Greytoes did not notice these beautiful things.
As she tripped along, she said to herself, “I wonder
if that cat-bird has built his nest in the same place this
spring. I dreamed about him last night, so I’ll go and
see.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sure enough, when she came to the tree, there was the
cat-bird sitting on a bent limb. Miss Kitty smacked her
lips, and was just about to spring at him, when Whirr!
whirr! sung a big beetle, and the cat-bird flew away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Miss Greytoes,” said the beetle, bowing
politely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“None the better for seeing you, Mr. Beetle,” she replied;
“some folks are forever in the way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Heigho! Miss Kitty, you’re cross this morning.
Didn’t your supper agree with you? I saw you through
the pantry window, last night, stealing cream. It will do
you good to fast to-day. Good-bye.” And away he flew
to tell his friend, the cat-bird, the joke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meddlesome old thing!” snapped Miss Greytoes, as
she trotted off with her tail in the air.</p>

In Bologna, an Italian city, there lived an old
musician who had a beautiful little boy. He
taught him to sing, and play on the harp, but
Guido loved drawing better than music, and
instead of practicing, made pictures and little figures
in clay.</p>

<p class='c005'>His father thought this a waste of time, and gave him
many whippings, but nothing could prevent the little fellow
from drawing. When his paper was taken away, he
marked on the walls, and after he had filled them, he drew
pictures in the dust.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Guido’s good luck came at last. His father gave a
concert at the palace of a great lord, and Guido went with
him. He met there a famous painter, who was so pleased
when he saw the boy’s pictures, that he advised his father
to let him be an artist.</p>

<p class='c005'>To his great joy Guido was put in a studio, and studied
so well, that when he was thirteen, his master made him
teach the other scholars. As the years went by, he became
a wonderful painter, and even kings paid the highest prices
for his pictures.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crowning glory of his whole life was his famous
painting of Aurora, on the ceiling of a summer-house of a
palace in Rome.</p>

Maggie is carrying her father’s breakfast
to him. She was in the middle of
a pleasant dream this morning when
her mother came to her little cot, and
said, “Wake up, Maggie, it is almost
five o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear me,” yawned Maggie, “what
a bother!” And I fear she did not have
a very cheerful face, as she trudged to
the wheat field.</p>

<p class='c005'>The air was sweet with the smell of clover, the dew-drops
sparkled in the sunshine, and the birds were singing
gayly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter?” said a dew-drop on a white rosebud?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m so sleepy,” answered Maggie, “and it’s a hard case
to have to get up at five o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For shame,” said the dew-drop, “I’ve been at work all
night watering this flower, and presently, the sun will dry
me up. If you had come half an hour later, we shouldn’t
have met.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lazy little girl,” cried a skylark, “I have been flying
a mile high already, and had a nice air bath. Now, I’m
going to hunt for my breakfast.” And away he flew, joyously

“Janet,” said Mrs. Bruce, “somebody is in the
children’s cot at last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m so glad, mamma. Who is it? A boy or
girl?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A boy, and one whom you know—Frank
Fenton. Yesterday his pony threw him, and broke
his arm. I believe his leg was hurt also. It happened near
the ‘Retreat,’ and he was carried there. When his father
arrived, and found him so comfortable, he let him remain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What good news! Think, mamma, of Frank Fenton
lying in the bed that we little girls paid for. I wonder if
he will like our picture screen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Retreat” was a private hospital, and Mrs. Bruce
was one of the managers. Janet and her little friends
had fitted up a cot in the children’s ward, from the proceeds
of a fair, which they had held. Imagine their
pleasure, when the first patient proved to be one of their
companions.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Frank was better, Janet went to see him
every day. She made an excellent little nurse, and the
two had great fun over the screen, inventing stories to
suit the pictures.</p>

<p class='c005'>Janet now felt the sweet satisfaction of doing good.
“Mamma,” said she, “when I hear the hymn, ‘A charge
to keep I have,’ it reminds me of Frank. He’s my charge.”</p>

Nurse was sick, so mamma had to take care of
Baby Belle. They walked down the shady lane
to meet papa, and Nipo, Baby Belle’s little
dog, given her by her papa on her first birthday,
trotted on behind. Baby had on the lace cap that
Aunt Fanny had sent her all the way from New
York, and looked sweet enough to eat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Putty fowers,” said she, spying the daisies and butter-cups.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ess, and butty-tups too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Doggie, does oo love butter?” and Baby Belle put her
fat hand, full of butter-cups, under Nipo’s nose. Nipo
was a good-natured little dog and loved Baby, so he
wagged his tail to say, “Yes.” Then he gave a joyful
bark, and ran off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa is coming,” said mamma; “now for a ride,” and
she and Baby followed Nipo.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the stile Baby Belle got a dozen kisses from papa,

home on papa’s shoulder as proud as a queen.</p>

Annie had been to lunch with her little friend,
Katie Heath. All the dolls were invited,
and a merry time they had. It being summer,
the table was spread in the arbor.
Katie’s uncle brought her last Christmas
from Japan a beautiful set of dolls’ china.
This was arranged on a white cloth, and the
tea tasted very good out of the pretty little
tea-pot. There was also a sponge cake, which Katie had
made with her own hands, for her mamma wished her to
be a good housekeeper. After tea and sandwiches, they had
strawberries and cream, to eat with the cake. The dolls
sat at the table, and enjoyed themselves very much—only
Mr. Punchinello, who is such a tease, would make fun of
dear little Polly Primrose’s old-fashioned bonnet. She
was used to his nonsense, and would not have cared, except
that Marie de Montfort, Katie’s new doll, had on her
Paris finery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Polly looks very sad on her way home, but I think it
is because Mr. Eugene Montmorenci is going to marry
Mademoiselle Marie. It was all arranged after lunch, and
the wedding is to be next Tuesday, Annie’s birthday.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cheer up, dear Polly, something very nice is in store for
you too.</p>

I am glad my mistress is out, that I may
have the mirror all to myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, I am a beauty! though that
spiteful cat next door says my face is
streaked. She calls me “Miss Vanity,”
but my good looks got me this nice
home, with plenty to eat, and nothing
to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is the way it came about. My
mother belonged to a little French boy
named Henri, and being a French cat, she was very clever.
One day when I was a tiny baby, a lady from New York
came to stay at the house. My mother lay on the rug
listening to the conversation, but pretending to be asleep.
Henri said to the lady, “My cat has kittens, and one of
them is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah,” said she, “I wish I could see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon hearing this, my mother trotted down stairs, and
brought me up in her mouth. My, what a shout there
was when we appeared! The lady said she must have the
kitten of so wise a cat, and that I was perfectly lovely.</p>

<p class='c005'>She promised Henri to be very good to me, so I was put
in a basket, and brought to New York, where I am much
admired, and happy as the day is long.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last thing my mother said to me was, “Beauty is as
beauty does.” I wonder what she meant?</p>

Marie was a little Southern girl, and had never
seen a snow-storm. When she was ten years old,
she spent a winter at the North with her cousins.</p>

<p class='c005'>One morning she awoke, and looking out of the
window, saw something soft and white falling.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cousin Caroline, run here,” she said; “they must be
picking cotton up in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her cousin told her that it was snow, and in the afternoon
she should go sleighing. I am sure that Marie will
never forget her first sleigh ride.</p>

<p class='c005'>But more fun was coming. When the ice became firm,
Caroline and her brothers went to the Park to skate.
Marie did not know how to skate, but Harold said she
must have a slide on the ice, and that he would take good
care of her. So Marie was tucked snugly into a sled, with
plenty of robes to keep her warm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edmund played horse and pulled, while Harold did the
pushing.</p>

This Laplander looks as if he were sitting for his
photograph, though I don’t expect photographers
ever go to such a cold country as his. Lapland,
you know, is in the northern part of Russia, and
the people there dress in furs and skins all the
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>To go swiftly over the snow, they wear big shoes like
the one the man is holding. These are strapped on the
feet, and a Lapland boy skims along faster than any of you
can skate.</p>

<p class='c005'>But think of it—he never tasted a peach or a strawberry
in his life. In his cold home only a few small trees and
bushes grow. There are no fruits or vegetables, and the
only food is the flesh of the reindeer, and fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>The houses are round huts, with a hole at the top to let
the smoke out.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Laplander’s fortune is in his reindeer, and his only
business, the care of large herds of them. A little Lapland
baby lies in a cradle made of wood hollowed out and filled
with white moss. Pieces of leather are laced across the
top, and the mother fastens the cradle to her back when
she travels.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lazy little people who don’t like school, should go to
Lapland, for there, if a boy knows his A, B, C, he is thought
very learned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, we’ll get some for mamma, and then she will tell

<p class='c005'>The next morning Charlie and Anna spent in the
woods. Charlie pulled the flowers that Anna could not
reach, and she carried home a big bunch, which her mamma
put in a vase. There were dandelions, cowslips, jonquils,
and woodbine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does dandelion mean that the lion is a dandy,
mamma?” asked Anna.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear, that comes from a French word—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dent-de-lion</span></i>—lion’s
teeth. Another flower from the French is the
pansy, which means <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensée</span></i>, thought, and the emblem is,
Think of me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you tell us anything about the jonquil?” asked
Charlie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That flower belongs to the Narcissus family. There
is a pretty story about it. Once there lived a beautiful
boy named Narcissus. While hunting one day, he sat
down by a stream to rest, and seeing his face in the water,
fell in love with it. Because he couldn’t get his picture,
he pined away, and the fairies changed him into a flower.”</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
My boy Charlie has made a cork boat, and is blowing
it about to try and make it sink, but it is
like a life-boat, and will not go over. Did you
ever see a life-boat? and do you know what
makes it different from other boats? or why it
is so called? Perhaps you don’t know, so I
will tell you, for all knowledge is pleasant and useful.</p>

<p class='c005'>A life-boat is so called because it is useful in saving life.
When a ship is in distress, a life-boat can put off from the
shore and reach the ship, and then come back again laden
with the poor people it has saved from drowning, because it
can live in a sea where any other boat would sink and be lost.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why is this?” you ask. That is just what I am going
to explain. So, stop blowing, Charlie, and come and listen
to me.</p>

<p class='c005'>A life-boat is lined with cork; in other words, it has a
compartment or inside casing filled in with cork, or sometimes
with large thin metal air-tight tubes; this is done to
make it buoyant, that is, able to keep bounding along the
stormy sea instead of sinking to the bottom. For cork
will not sink. Stick a sail to it, and blow as Charlie has
done, but you will not blow it over easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>The brave men who man the life-boat must be made safe,
too; so they wear cork jackets, and life-belts filled with
cork, and take life-buoys with them. A life-buoy is a large
round casing filled with cork, with a hole in the middle
large enough to slip over a man’s head and shoulders, and
it will keep him from sinking to have one on.</p>

Hare. I won’t hurt you.”</p>

I was playing that I was in a jungle, and

you were a lion. Where did you come

ones are waiting for me in the hollow tree yonder.”</p>

long brown ears like you, Molly? I never saw a baby

Nurse and George were standing by the garden
gate one fine summer afternoon. George had
been playing in the hay field, making nests in the
sweet hay for himself and nurse.</p>

<p class='c005'>And they had tossed the hay about, and thrown
it at each other, and had had a good game of play.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now nurse and George were both tired, and they
were going into the house to have some tea.</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then, Tom, the carter, passed by, leading one of the
horses, and he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think not,” said nurse. “He has never been on a
horse.”</p>

there is no fear of his tumbling off.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
